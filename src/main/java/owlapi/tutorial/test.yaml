          description: A list of ontologies used to generate this API. Note that while the prefix names used here correspond with the ones given in the JSON-LD @context for the supported data types, the prefix mapping in the API is based on the Ontology IRIs given in those @context blocks, which may differ from the values given here (which give priority to version IRIs).
